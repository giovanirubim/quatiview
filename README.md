# QuatiView

This is a web tool meant for educational purposes. Mainly learning and practicing data structures and algorithms.

You can use it to write C code (a simpler subset of the language) on the code editor, then run your code and see a visualization of your data structures (for now lists and binary trees).

The tool is publicly accessible in this link: [https://giovanirubim.github.io/quatiview/](https://giovanirubim.github.io/quatiview/)

Check the sample files [here](https://github.com/giovanirubim/quatiview/tree/main/samples).
